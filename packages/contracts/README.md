# Advanced Sample Hardhat Project

```shell
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
```

What would a merkle mapping look like:

```
{
    address tokenAddress;
    uint256 fromTokenId;
    uint256 toTokenId;
    uint256 genesis;
    uint256 milkPerToken;
    uint256 duration;
}
```

This will create a root for the same.

## MERKLE

-   Every tokenId of a given token address can have only one rule
